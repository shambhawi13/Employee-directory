# Employee Directory
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.
The user should be able to:
- Sort the table by at least one category
- Filter the users by at least one property.


```
Here is how the application works:
